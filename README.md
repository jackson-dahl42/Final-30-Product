# UBMP4 Game Console

This is a culminating project for a computer technology course. For my culminating project I had to use a UBMP4, which uses a PIC16F1459. You can find out 
more about the UBMP4 at this website: https://mirobo.tech/ubmp4 

The project I chose to create was a game console. The game console contains two games. One game is based off of the Google dinosaur game. The second game is based off the defender arcade game. You can find the documentation of me creating the project and my progress in the project diary.
